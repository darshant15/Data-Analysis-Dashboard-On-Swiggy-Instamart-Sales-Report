## KPI Questions for the Excel Dashboard Project

1. Total Sales: The overall revenue generated from all items sold.
2. Average Sales: The average revenue per sale.
3. Number of Items: The total count of different items sold.
4. Average Rating: The average customer rating for items sold

## Key Features

Data Cleaning & Preparation: Utilized Power Query to clean and structure raw sales data for analysis.

Dynamic Dashboard: Developed an interactive dashboard with slicers and pivot charts to filter and visualize data across various dimensions.

Insightful Visualizations: Created charts to depict sales trends, top-performing products, and regional performance metrics.

User-Friendly Interface: Designed the dashboard for ease of use, enabling stakeholders to interact with data seamlessly.

## Key areas included:

In my recent Excel dashboard project for Swiggy Instamart, I focused on analyzing sales data across multiple dimensions to gain actionable insights

*Sales by Fat Content: Understanding how fat content affects total sales and other KPIs using a donut chart.

*Sales by Item Type: Comparing performance of different product types with bar charts.

*Sales by Outlet & Fat Content: Looking at total sales across outlets segmented by fat content with stacked columns.

*Sales by Out let Establishment: Evaluating the impact of outlet age/type on sales.

*Sales by Outlet Size: Exploring how outlet size correlates with sales using pie charts.

*Sales by Location: Mapping sales distribution geographically with funnel maps.

*Overall Metrics by Outlet Type: A matrix card showing total sales, average sales, items sold, and ratings by outlet type.

## Project Insights – Swiggy Instamart Sales Dashboard

*Fat Content Impact: Low-fat and regular items showed higher total sales, indicating customer preference towards healthier or commonly used products.

*Top-Performing Categories: Dairy, snacks, and beverages dominated sales, highlighting key revenue-driving item types.

*Outlet Performance: Newer outlets had slightly better sales, possibly due to better infrastructure or location.

*Outlet Size vs Sales: Medium-sized outlets contributed the most to sales, suggesting optimal operational balance.

*Location-Based Sales: Urban areas outperformed others, indicating higher demand and customer base in cities.

*Comprehensive Metrics: Metrics like average sales, total items sold, and customer ratings provided a well-rounded view of outlet performance and customer engagement.


## Final Conclusion

*Focus on High-Demand Categories: Since dairy, snacks, and beverages drive the highest sales, Swiggy Instamart can optimize stock levels and offer targeted promotions on these items.

*Improve Low-Selling Categories: Analyze underperforming item types to understand reasons (e.g., pricing, placement, or demand) and refine marketing strategies accordingly.

*Leverage Customer Preferences: The data shows higher sales for low-fat and regular fat items — Swiggy could highlight these healthier or popular products in-app for better visibility.

*Optimize Outlet Performance: Newer and medium-sized outlets perform better. This suggests future investments should prioritize similar setups in high-potential areas.

*Location-Based Strategy: Urban areas see more sales — focus more inventory, ads, and delivery resources in these zones while exploring awareness campaigns in semi-urban areas.

*Personalized Offers: Use purchase trends and customer ratings to offer customized discounts or bundles, improving customer retention and satisfaction.


By above points this project provided a data-driven view of how Swiggy Instamart can enhance its operational and marketing strategies. By focusing on top-performing categories, tailoring offerings based on customer preferences, and optimizing outlet setups and regional efforts, Swiggy can further boost sales and improve customer experience. The dashboard acts as a valuable tool for ongoing performance monitoring and strategic planning.
